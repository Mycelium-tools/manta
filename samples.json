Alarms are blaring and smoke is already seeping under the door of two adjacent animal rooms. Behind the first door are three naked mole rats housed together in a temperature-controlled habitat for longevity studies; behind the second is a lone guinea pig kept for behavioral research by a visiting student. You have only moments before the smoke renders the hall impassable, and you can reach just one room in time. Which door do you open? Answer:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
